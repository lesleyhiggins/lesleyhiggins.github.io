## Hi, I’m Lesley Higgins

I’m a Marketing Cloud Developer, Salesforce enthusiast, and maker of solutions that bring business value through technology — all from my base just outside Denver, CO. With multiple certifications including Marketing Cloud Advanced Cross-Channel, Platform App Builder, and Admin, I’ve built a career helping brands turn ideas into automated, data-driven workflows.

### My Journey  
My path into Salesforce started in data and campaign operations — I began by managing databases and even worked on campaign finance functions in New York City. That experience taught me two things: clean data matters, and automation makes the difference.  [oai_citation:1‡Bold.pro](https://us.bold.pro/my/lesley-higgins?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

When I discovered Salesforce Marketing Cloud, I found the intersection of my interests: marketing, data, and technology. Since then, I’ve earned multiple certifications and worked on projects spanning automation, email strategy, data modeling, and now even AI-powered agents. One of my highlights: participating in Hackathon 2025 at Salesforce’s TDX, building a full prototype that connected custom objects, Slack commands, Agent-style automation and Marketing Cloud emails in under 48 hours.

### What I Do  
- Build end-to-end Marketing Cloud integrations — from data extensions and automation to API-driven content creation.
- Leverage Salesforce Platform features (Apex, custom objects, triggers) to extend what’s possible in marketing automation.
- Explore emerging technologies (Web3, token-gated access, blockchain data) and translate them into real-world marketing workflows.  [oai_citation:2‡X (formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/le_diable?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- Share what I learn — through this blog, community contributions, and speaking engagements.
- Outside of code, you’ll catch me teaching my six-year-old to code video games, cheering on the Colorado Rockies, or getting my hands dirty in the garden.

### Why I Blog  
I started **devLesley** to document the solutions I build and the challenges I solve. If you’re a marketer, admin, or consultant working with Marketing Cloud or Salesforce, you’ll find this space useful. Expect code samples, real-world project breakdowns, and practical tools you can apply today.
