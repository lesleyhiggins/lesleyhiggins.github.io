## Hi, I’m Lesley Higgins

I’m a Marketing Cloud Developer, Salesforce enthusiast, and creator of solutions that bring business value through technology. With **21 certifications spanning Salesforce core, Marketing Cloud, Slack, and more**, I’ve built a career helping brands turn ideas into automated, data-driven workflows.

### My Journey  
My path into Salesforce started in data and campaign operations. Before shifting into full-time cloud work, I worked in database administration and campaign operations for high-stakes environments. That experience taught me two things: clean data matters, and automation makes the difference.

When I discovered Salesforce Marketing Cloud, I found the intersection of my interests: marketing, data, and technology. Since then, I’ve earned multiple certifications and worked on projects spanning automation, email strategy, data modeling, and most recently AI-powered agents. 

### What I Do  
- Build end-to-end Marketing Cloud integrations — from data extensions and automation to API-driven content creation.  
- Leverage Salesforce Platform features (Apex, custom objects, triggers) to extend what’s possible in marketing automation.  
- Explore emerging technologies (Web3, token-gated access, blockchain data) and translate them into practical marketing workflows.  
- Share what I learn — through this blog, community posts, and speaking sessions.  

### Why I Blog  
I started **devLesley** to document the solutions I build and the challenges I solve. If you’re a marketer, admin, or consultant navigating Marketing Cloud and Salesforce, this space is for you. Expect code samples, real-world project stories, and tools you can adapt today.
